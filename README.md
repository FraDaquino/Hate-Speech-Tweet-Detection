# Hate Speech Tweet Detection
Text Analytics Project @UniPi a.y. 2023/24

This repository contains the code and report for a text analytics project focused on hate speech detection.

Detecting hate speech has become crucial to fostering healthy communication in online discussions and protecting minority voices[1]. Given the importance of combating the spread of toxic language on social media platforms, this project aims to further research in this field by focusing on a dataset of religious and political tweets collected from X (formerly known as Twitter).
The project is based on the HaSpeeDe31 shared task, organized as part of [Evalita 2023](https://www.evalita.it/campaigns/evalita-2023/tasks/), with a similar focus on the importance of identifying online hateful content across various domains.

The main tasks of the project include:
- exploratory analysis of tweets and user descriptions using Topic Modeling techniques;
- hate speech detection through binary classification;
- efforts to improve classification performance by balancing the target variable and incorporating metadata.
