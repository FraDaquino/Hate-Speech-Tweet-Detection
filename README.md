# Hate Speech Tweet Detection
Text Analytics Project @UniPi a.y. 2023/24

The detection of hate speech has become crucial to promote an healthy communication in online discussion or to protect minority voices[1]. For this reason, considering that hate detection can be used to fight the proliferation of toxic language spreading on social media platforms, in this work we seek to expand the research in this field focusing on a dataset containing some religious and political tweets obtained from the
the platform X, formerly known as Twitter. 
In particular, we based our work on the HaSpeeDe31 shared task organized within Evalita 2023 with the same idea of putting importance to the identification of online hateful content in many fields.
In particular, it is possible to summarize the main tasks of the project in:
- exploratory analysis of tweets and user description using Topic Modeling technique;
- hate speech detection via binary classification;
- attempts to improve binary classification performance through target variable balancing and use of metadata.
